# Mutify - mute annoying ads

A powerful, light-weight & permission-free Spotify Ad silencing app built using Java for Android.

Whenever Mutify detects Spotify is playing an ad, it turns down the music volume to zero, so that you can sit back and enjoy listening to your favorite music without worrying about those annoyingly loud Spotify ads.

## Instructions </br>

- You MUST enable 'Device Broadcast Status' in Spotify settings for Mutify to work.
- Please add Mutify to battery saving exceptions list to make sure it works un-interruptedly in the background!

## Features </br>

- Simple and Clean User interface
- Option to enable Dark-Only mode
- Manual mute/unmute buttons
- Controls media without leaving the app

### Disclaimer

Mutify does NOT block ads, it just mutes the device's music volume whenever an ad is detected playing. So it does not interfere with your Spotify app or asks for any unnecessary permissions to work.

- **_Spotify Lite is NOT supported yet!_**
